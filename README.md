# Fixunum_override

## Makers Academy Week 4 Exercise

###Aim

To override the method "inspect" so that it returns its word equivalent for numbers ranging 0 to 9. For all numbers outside of this range, it simply outputs its numerical number as a string.

###Example:
* 0.inspect 	=> "zero"
* 1.inspect 	=> "one"
* 9.inspect 	=> "nine"
* 10.inspect 	=> "10"
* 11.inspect 	=> "11"

###Other details
* In my version I opted to use Italian word equivalents for the ranges, as part of my continued learnig of the Itlaian language. 

* The test was set by Evgeny Shadnev [@shadnev](https://github.com/shadnev)
