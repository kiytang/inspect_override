# Fixunum_override

## Makers Academy Week 4 Exercise

###Aim

To override the method "inspect" so that it returns its word equivalent for numbers ranging 0 to 9. For all numbers outside of this range, it simply outputs its numerical number as a string.

###Example:
*0.inspect #=> "zero"
*1.inspect #=> "one"
*9.inspect #=> "nine"
*10.inspect #=> "10"
*11.inspect #=> "11"
